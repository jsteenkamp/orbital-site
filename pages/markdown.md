This is a long paragraph... Often when working on responsive layouts, it's useful to adjust styles across a singular dimension – such as font-size, margin, padding, and width. Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout a code base, styled-system offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach. While this syntax can seem odd at first, it can become a powerful way to manage responsive typography and layouts.
