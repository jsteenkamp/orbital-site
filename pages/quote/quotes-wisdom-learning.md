The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place. - *George Bernard Shaw*

An engineer starts with complexity and crafts certainty - *Richard Rumelt*

The hacker culture and its successes pose by example some fundamental questions about human motivation, the organization of work, the future of professionalism, and the shape of the firm. - *Eric Raymond*

Great products come from changing the focus. From productivity to impact. From predicatability to experimentation. From efficiency to decentralization. From product to problem. - *Mary Poppendieck*

Do the simple thing first - *Instagram*

A good strategy is a set of actions that is credible, coherent and focused on overcoming the biggest hurdle(s) in achieving a particular objective. - *Richard Rumelt*

Working hard is great, but don’t confuse motion for progress. - *Julie Zuho (@joulee)*

Understand and make clear the project goals, constraints, and assumptions.

Because as soon as you make it about hours, their job becomes less about code and more about hours. - *Zach Holman*

Do the riskiest tasks first, don't give yourself the illusion of progress by focusing on what's easiest first.

If I stay for another year, what am I going to learn and what will be different? - *@kevingoldsmith*

Today's office is a wasteland. It saps vitality, blocks talent, and frustrates accomplishment. It is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort. - *Robert Propst (Herman Miller)*

More effective than defining specific goals is outlining measurable milestones to achieve them. Aim to deliver new value at each milestone.

Project schedules slip when we allow the target (business) to alter the estimate (engineering).

Balance quality with pragmatism. It is possible to over-invest in quality to the point where there are diminishing returns for the time spent.

Simple made easy. Simple things take on one role, fulfill one task, accomplish one objective, and deal wth one concept. - *Rich Hickey*

Simple abstractions avoid interweaving multiple concepts so you can reason about them independently rather than together.

To help users scale we want to make tasks effortless. To help the platform scale we want to minimize the numer of tools we need to support.

Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.

Change the cost. Change the behavior.

Constraints are changes in the probability of particular actions, an incentive landscape.

Change the incentive landscape by making the way you want people to do things the easy way to do things.

Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by the cost of change. - *Grady Booch*

Architecture is about structure, decomposing the product into components, modules and interactions.

Architecture is about process, understanding what to build, a vision for building it, and making appropriate design decisions.

Work is exploration to define the problems and the solutions - *Esko Kilpi*

Creativity, Impact and Control define great work - *Cal Newport*

Progress your career. Gain mastery as an individual contributor and make magic. Provide spectacular support to those who are doing the former.

Simplicity is a competitive advantage. You cannot add simplicity in. You must take complexity out.

Most methodologies have the effect of dampening performance outliers. For strong teams this will lower their performance. - *@raganwald*

The question is not whether to thinnk or build. The question is when to think and when to build, and the how of either. - *@kingshukdar*

Capability, the realm of what you can do is not the problem. The qiestion is, of all the things you can do, which ones should you do?

Real-time encourages distraction, asynchronous encourages focus - *Jason Fried*

The most powerful way to create value for your customer is creating value with your customer - *Esko Kilpi*

The absolute fastest way to complete a task or reach an objective is to realize you don't have to.

As a rough model your career success and growth is proportional to the value you create - *Edmond Lau*

Technical ability to write code and build software plateaus over time. You get good at it so improvements are smaller. (Technical Ability + Experience ≠ Impact).

Identify and solve problems that are core to the business and enable those around you to effectively solve there problems. (Leverage = Impact created / Time invested).

To grow your career you must be in a growing company.

"Idea debt" - imagining future projects can hold you back as you spend too much time picturing and way too little time making. - *@jccabel*

If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will - *Essentialism*

Oh, hope is not a business strategy - *@jmspool*

The more talent density you have the less process you need. The more process you create the less talent you retain. - *Reed Hastings (Netflix)*

I'm a 10X engineer where X is my original estimate - *@deech*

It worked so well I quit doing it - *@ryanflorence*

The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place - *George Bernard Shaw*

If you want to build a ship don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast endless sea. - *Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (Little Prince)*

You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything - *John Maxwell*

Engineering (*compromise*) is the intersection of science (*theoretically possible*) and economics (*economically feasible*)

The problem with code reuse is that it gets in the way of chaning your mind later on.

Instead of building reusable software build disposable software.

The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do - *Michael Porter*

40% rule. For sustainable high performance the annual revenue growth rate plus  operating margin must be greater than or equal to 40%. - *Brad Feld*

Taking ownership is the most effective way to get what you want - *Edmond Lau*

Arbitrary deadlines destory predictability. Market driven deadlines with continuous delivery enable predictability.  - *@duarte_vasco #NoEstimates*

Use exploratory coding and prototyping to understand the landscape, not flawed estimation based on assumptions.

Software Uncertainty Principle: If you know what's in it, you don't know when it will ship. If you know when it will ship, you don't know what's in it.

You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.  - *Mark Hedlund, Etsy*

Development is not about a squence of sprints, we need to have time to think about what we are actually building - *@anatolyz*

Done is a decision, not a definition.

Development is not about a sequence of sprints. We need to have time to think about what we are atually building. - *@anatolyz*

Agile is about having the right people. Scrum is what happens when the wrong people bring their process.

Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability - *Edsger Dijkstra*

When our new ideas fail it's usually because we are overconfident about how well our customers would understand and how much they would care - *GV Sprint*

The key to staying relevant to your customers and defending/growing your business model does not come from throwing more features (solutions) at them, but rather continuously uncovering problems and addressing them — before your competitors do. - *Ash Maurya*
