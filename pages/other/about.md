Great work is defined by creativity, impact, and control.

I roll up my sleeves, get stuck in, and show people how to design, plan, build, and ship products together.

## My approach to just about everything

- Do the simple thing first.
- Take the path that makes future change easier.

## Building stuff

- Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by the cost of change - *Grady Booch*
- Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction - *Sandi Metz*
- Don't do anything that takes longer than 2 weeks
- Do the riskiest tasks first
- Balance quality with pragmatism
- Release frequently
- Favor composition over inheritance
