I get stuck in and show people how to plan, build, and ship products together.

## My approach to just about everything

- Start with a blank canvas
- Embrace constraints
- Take the path that makes future change easier
- Do the simple thing first

## Building stuff

- Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by the cost of change - *Grady Booch*
- Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction - *Sandi Metz*
- Don't do anything that takes longer than 2 weeks
- Do the riskiest tasks first
- Balance quality with pragmatism
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Make frequent releases
