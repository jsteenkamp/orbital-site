Great work is defined by creativity, impact, and control.

I roll up my sleeves, get stuck in, and show people how to design, plan, build, and ship products together.

> Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by the cost of change - *Grady Booch*

## Building stuff

- Do the simple thing first.
- Take the path that makes future change easier.
- Release frequently.
- Don't do anything that takes longer than 2 weeks.
- Do the riskiest tasks first.
- Balance quality with pragmatism.
- Favor composition over inheritance.

> Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction - *Sandi Metz*
