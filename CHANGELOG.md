## ToDo

* Better way to handle quotes `blockquote` and `cite`. Store quotes as json or object? 
* Add quote to all sections, currently a single quote document with one quote is rendered via MDX on home page only.

* Checking GitHub flow in detail. How to handle Issues and PRs with Project Boards. 

## 24/07/2018

* PoC items addressed. CSS-in-JS uses `styled-components` via `styled-system` and `system-components`.
* Use `MDX` which allows adding React components in Markdown. 
* Restructured into sub-directories.
* Deploy as static site using nextjs `pages` structure for routing.

* Proof Of Concept
* Use my preferred React libraries with Next.js? The most import for 100% static output are preferred CSS-in-JS libraries.
* Markdown authoring experience and ease of integration for rendering and navigation.
* Linking static assets/resources in content (images, files).
* Start with a single page, implement visual design, layout, core components (Header, Navigation).
